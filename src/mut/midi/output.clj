(ns mut.midi.output
  "An interface for playing notes via standard Java MIDI Synthesizer.

  Playing sound implies side effects. It is a slow and stateful process and
  thus is hard for testing. So this module isolates the playing process in order
  to protect entire application from this hazard.

  Other modules don't play MIDI on the fly. Instead, they generate sequences of
  stateless instructions. And then the sequence is passed to the `play` function
  that does the I/O.
  An example of how that happens (very simplified):
  (def song
    [(note-on 60)
     (note-on 67)
     (pause 1000)
     (note-on 60)
     (pause 500)
     (note-on 63)
     (pause 250)
     (note-on 72)
     (pause 1000)
     (note-off 60)
     (note-off 63)
     (note-off 67)
     (note-off 72)])  ; <- pure data, no side effects
  (play-midi song)    ; <- sound output, side effects happen here

  So the process of playing MIDI is split into two steps:
    1. Generating music (creating a sequence of MIDI instructions)
    2. Playing it (making sound output according to these instructions)
  Other modules generate the music, and this module plays it.

  Such approach has several major advantages:
  - Functions that generate music don't need to perform I/O and thus they become
    fast and pure, and they may easily be covered by automated unit tests.
  - Functions that play music may be optimized to reduce I/O latency.
    If other modules would generate music and play it on the fly, they may
    introduce accidental delays and thus make timing not very precise.
    This is not acceptable for ear training software. So we let music generators
    to work arbitrary amounts of time; we just take their output and play it
    here with minimal I/O delays.

  So we separate the processes of generation and playing the music.
  The generation process (done in other modules) may be slow and sophisticated.
  The playing process (done here) must be dumb and fast (minimal I/O delays).

  This module contains three main entities:
  1. `play-midi` function.
     It takes a sequence of instructions and plays the music according to them.
  2. `MidiInstruction` type.
     It describes one MIDI event (NoteOn, NoteOff, pause, etc).
  3. A bunch of helper constructor functions for MidiInstruction:
     note-on, note-off, pitch-bend, control-change, pause, etc.

;; MidiInstruction represents one action performed by the `play-midi` function.

;; When you want to play music you generate a sequence of MidiInstruction

;; Fields have primitive type hints to avoid autoboxing overhead and
;; perhaps to save memory because sequences of such instructions may be
;; very long (up to a million of objects for a complex song).

   Example:

   This value is necessary because the MIDI command takes a value in range
